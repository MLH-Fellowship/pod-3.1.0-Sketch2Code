# Sketch2Code
Sketch-2-Code is a project which focuses on making coding easier and simpler. When it comes to coding in Swift, if we have any* doubts we refer to tutorials, blogs, etc, that was the usual way, But no more old procedures. Sketch-2-Code is the new method to find help. Provide your UI Sketch or Text down your requirements and everything else will be taken care of by S2C(Sketch 2 Code).

 ## Features
- ```Sketch to Code``` Detects images of UIElements and presents the code snippet for respective elements in both UIKit & SwiftUI.
- ```Text to Code``` feature added for basic UIElements
- Supported UIElements in this version include Button, Label & Textfield. 
- An Image classifier model to differentiate b/w various shapes of UIElement like a button. 
- ```Save Snippet``` feature added, now user can save all his snippets in the app.

## Requirements to Run
- Xcode 12+
- Swift 5+
- To click an image for input the project needs to run on a physical device with iOS 14.5+ otherwise any image from the photo library can also be used on the simulator

## Limitations
- Right now S2C is not that powerful to help you in every prospect, but we are doing our best to provide you the best possible.
- When we say provide Sketch and Text it's not that simple because there is a set of procedures you need to follow to use S2C.
- With upcoming versions we focus on making S2C more powerful and more versatile
