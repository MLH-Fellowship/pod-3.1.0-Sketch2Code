# Explorer Template

This is a template to help you get started with your projects. Find out more information inside of the Fello Handbook.

This template has a `main` and `staging` branch already setup. 

- Code will only be merged into `main` once your Pod Leader has reviewed your code. 
- During the week, you'll merge code into `staging`.

## Useful commands

Switch branches:
```
git checkout <branch-name>
```

Make new branch and switch to it:
```
git checkout -b <branch-name>
```

I'd recommend using the GitHub CLI for reviewing Pull Requests, making Pull Requests and making Issues.

Download it with Homebrew:
```
brew install gh
```
